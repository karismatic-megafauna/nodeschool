# GIT

## What I know about GIT
It is a subversioning system made by LT. It is extremely powerful and I will
always have something to learn. I am pretty confident in my skils at git, but
there is always something else I could learn. The most important thing I know
about GIT is that you should always understand the command you are running and
don't just run things willy nilly

## What I learned about GIT
I know the basics pretty well! Could probably understand remotes a little better.
This tutorial was a lot more about github than I needed, would be great for someone
who has no / little exposure to working on large teams
